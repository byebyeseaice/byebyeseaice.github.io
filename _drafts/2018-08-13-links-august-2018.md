## Deep Adaptation

Every once in a while a paper is published that shines new light and clarity on the current state of things.

One such paper has been published on July 27th, 2018:

- [Deep Adaptation: A Map for Navigating Climate Tragedy](http://www.lifeworth.com/deepadaptation.pdf)

In the abstract, the author states that:

> The purpose of this conceptual paper is to provide readers with an opportunity to reassess their work and life in the face of an inevitable near term social collapse due to climate change. 

It is a sobering read - yet it doesn't try to "sugar-coat" the issue, and I find this very refreshing.

## Losing Earth

Great in-depth article from the New York Times about the events that unfolded in the 1980s. Published on August 1st, 2018:

- [Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html)

## Elsewhere in the news

Plenty of headlines this summer: 

- Wildfires all the way from California to the arctic circle in Scandinavia. 
- A heatwave that is affecting the entire northern hemisphere this summer.

Here I include some interesting reads that I've come across in the past few weeks.

- [Domino-effect of climate events could move Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/06/domino-effect-of-climate-events-could-push-earth-into-a-hothouse-state). Source: The Guardian.
- [In The Shadow of Total Biosphere Collapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/96q1d9/in_the_shadow_of_total_biosphere_collapse/): Reddit thread about how "Climate Change won't kill us, the total collapse of our biosphere will"
