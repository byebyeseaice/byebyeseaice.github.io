While social media and Internet forums can foster constructive dialogue on important topics, I have often seen discussions degenerate, and I do not wish to be the recipient of hate speech.

For this reason I have chosen to run this blog completely anonymously, and I will disable comments on all my posts.

What I can share about myself, is that I'm not an expert or a climate scientist. I'm a simple layman, and I'm trying to educate myself (and hopefully, others) about the world.
