"Bye Bye Sea Ice" refers to the Blue Ocean Event (BOE) that will be likely reached in one of the coming summers, as all sea ice will melt over the Arctic Circle. This is regarded as a major tipping point of the climate system, which will further accelerate global warming.

## About the author

While social media and Internet forums can foster constructive dialogue on important topics, I have often seen discussions degenerate, and I do not wish to be the recipient of hate speech.

For this reason I have chosen to run this blog completely anonymously, and I will disable comments on all my posts.

What I can share about myself, is that I'm not an expert or a climate scientist. I'm a simple layman, and I'm trying to educate myself (and hopefully, others) about the world we live in.
