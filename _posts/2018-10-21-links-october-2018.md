The 2018 summer heatwave, aside from [making me more irritable](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/07/10/harvard-study-finds-that-during-heat-waves-people-can-think-straight/WIVBzXPuiB0vVfm6DkVBcJ/story.html), inspired me to do some reading. 

I had originally intended to publish this in August 2018. But life got busy. 

So here we are in October. Here's a long list of collapse-related stuff that I've been reading between August and October 2018.

I think they make it pretty clear that we're headed for a dark place:
