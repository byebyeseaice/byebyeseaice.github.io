## Introduction

I started this blog as a channel to share my reflections about the current state of the world.

All the content that I will post here will be framed in the context of the ongoing [Sixth Mass Extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction). I will reference topics such as climate change, environmental degradation and social collapse.

I have been researching these topics in depth since 2016, and have come to the conclusion that society **will** collapse in the coming years and decades. Additionally, catastrophic climate change is **probable**, and near term human extinction is **possible**.

Time is short. The end is nigh. However, I am not here to advocate harmful or self-destructive behavior.

**Quite the opposite.**

All we have left is the time until we exhale our last breath. At least in my own life, there is so much to live for.

My message to anyone reading this blog is simple:

- Time is precious. Don't waste it.

- Find meaning in your own life.

- Cherish the things that make you happy.

- Take care of your on physical and mental health.

- Be kind, compassionate. Be good to those around you.

## About me

While social media and Internet forums can foster constructive dialogue on important topics, I have often seen discussions degenerate, and I do not wish to be the recipient of hate speech.

For this reason I have chosen to run this blog completely anonymously, and I will disable comments on all my posts.

What I can share about myself, is that I'm not an expert or a climate scientist. I'm a simple layman, and I'm trying to educate myself (and hopefully, others) about the world.

## References

There are many books, papers and articles that have contributed to my understanding of the human predicament. They are my compass for navigating the incessant (and often) contradictory information about climate change.

If I had to choose one book "to rule them all", I would recommend reading this:

- [Overshoot: The Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change Paperback](https://www.amazon.com/Overshoot-Ecological-Basis-Revolutionary-Change/dp/0252009886/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534149878&sr=8-1&keywords=Overshoot%3A+The+Ecological+Basis+of+Revolutionary+Change+Paperback) – June 1, 1982

It explains in great detail the concept of carrying capacity for planet Earth. I believe understanding this concept sets the correct frame of mind for any meaningful discussion on collapse.

A close second would be this:

- [Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet](https://www.amazon.com/Six-Degrees-Future-Hotter-Planet/dp/1426203853/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534180092&sr=8-1&keywords=six+degrees) – October 7, 2008.

I also regularly follow [/r/collapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/) on Reddit as a source of fresh information.

## Going Forward

I find it challenging to talk about collapse with friends, family and strangers. And I know I am not alone.

Yet, the implications of collapse are far reaching, and will deeply affect us in our lifetimes.

So I think it's worth sharing what I'm learning, and I will try to post here, when time allows.
