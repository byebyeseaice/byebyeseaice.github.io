Whilst in the middle of the 2018 summer heatwave, I've been reading some interesting material. Here are all the links.

## Deep Adaptation

Every once in a while a new paper is published, that shines new light and clarity on the issue of climate change and the consequences it will have in our lives.

One such paper has been published on July 27th, 2018:

- [Deep Adaptation: A Map for Navigating Climate Tragedy](http://www.lifeworth.com/deepadaptation.pdf)

In the abstract, the author states that:

> The purpose of this conceptual paper is to provide readers with an opportunity to reassess their work and life in the face of an inevitable near term social collapse due to climate change. 

It is a sobering read - yet it doesn't try to "sugar-coat" the issue, and I find this very refreshing.

This paper goes all the way to the top of my climate change "favourite" resources, alongside another cornerstone piece that was published in July 2017 by David Wallace-Wells:

- [The Uninhabitable Earth - Famine, economic collapse, a sun that cooks us: What climate change could wreak — sooner than you think](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html). Annotated edition [here](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans-annotated.html).

## Losing Earth

Great in-depth article from the New York Times about the events that unfolded in the 1980s. Published on August 1st, 2018:

- [Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html)

## Elsewhere in the news

Plenty of headlines this summer, with wildfires all the way from California to the arctic circle in Scandinavia, and a heatwave that is affecting the entire northern hemisphere.

Here I include some interesting reads that I've come across in the past few weeks.

## Videos 

Paul Beckwith has published some great content this month. My favourites:

- 2018-07-28 -[Arctic Blue Ocean Event Consequences: Air and Ocean Circulation Changes](https://youtu.be/i-wvtVoiA3c)
- 2018-07-24 - [Incessant Body Blows to Humanity From Abrupt Climate Change](https://youtu.be/fdtK2oH4M0c): Explains how the record heatwave of summer 2018 is not occurring during an El Nino event and why this is bad news. Also compares sea ice thickness between 2012 and 2018. This makes a BOE (blue ocean event) likely in the next five years.
